## Notes for Linux and Mac Users

__If you are on Linux or Mac, remember to add `winhttp` to the wine configuration overrides. Otherwise, BepInEx may not start with the game.__

Here's how to do that:
### Proton on Linux Users

```shell
# Set the Wine Prefix.
WINEPREFIX="/home/{Your Username}/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1058830/pfx"

# Run winecfg Using Proton.
"/home/{Your Username}/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Proton {Your Proton Version}/dist/bin/wine64" winecfg
```

### Otherwise

```shell
winecfg
```

### Then Navigate to the Libraries Tab
